# kommunikationsapp
This app is made in collaboration with SOSU Nyk√∏bing Falster and is meant for educational use only.
The app is meant as a project that can ease the daily communication between caretakers and persons who suffer from speech impediments.
The app can record and play words, which can be saved in categories along with descriptional pictures to be used in the communication.
